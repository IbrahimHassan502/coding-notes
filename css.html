          <h3>animatoin delay</h3>
          suppose you have multiple elements (say 3) you want to animate them so
          each one is delayed by some duration (say 2s) than the one before it.
          <br />
          instead of using <span class="code-btn">animation-delay</span> css to
          delay each one which is not practical in case of big numners.You but
          customized <span class="code-btn">data-*</span> (say data-delay) on
          each one with the number of seconds (or milliseconds) delay you want
          for thet particular element and then wirte the following css:
          <span class="code-btn">animation-delay: attr(data-delay)</span>
          and now you have as many animations as you want seperated by certain
          cumulative duration with just one line of css üòÉ.

          <h3>
            justify self & justify items <b>work only with grid</b> and don't
            work with <b>flexbox</b>
          </h3>
          <blockquote>
            The <span class="code-btn"> justify-self and </span>
            <span class="code-btn">justify-items</span> properties
            <b>are not implemented in flexbox</b>. This is due to the
            one-dimensional nature of flexbox, and that there may be multiple
            items along the axis, making it impossible to justify a single item.
            To align items along the main, inline axis in flexbox you use the
            justify-content property.
          </blockquote>
          <b>
            as in the flexbox (on the main axis) children are treated as a group

              note in order to be able to explain the difference we will talk
              about grid element

          <p>
            <span class="second-color">visually: </span>
            <span class="code-btn">align-item</span> aligns each item in its own
            grid area.
          </p>
          <p>
            while in <span class="code-btn">align-content</span> will pack them
            in the top of the container. like shown in the pervious image.
          </p>

          <p>
            example: <span class="code-btn">align-items: start</span> will
            results in the image below.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="second-color">under the hood: </span>
            <span class="code-btn">align-items</span> sets the value of
            <span class="code-btn">align-self</span> for all child elements at
            once.
          </p>

          <p>
            while <span class="code-btn">align-content</span> deals with the
            grid lines itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>
              the images below are for align-conetent start and align-conetent

            <span class="second-color"> why the elements got taller ? </span>
            <br />
            in the code on mdn the first two elemnts were set to span to rows
            <b>so</b> it's basically stretches from the beginning of the first
            row to the end of the second row and since the space between the
            rows got taller the end of the row got further resulting in the
            elements got taller.

          <h3>:focus-within</h3>
          <p>
            it applies style on the element if the element itself or any of its
            children is focused
          </p>
          <p>
            in the case with just <span class="code-btn">:focus</span> when you
            focus on any of the elements children the focus on the elemenet is
            lost

        <section>
          <h3>place-items</h3>
          <p>
            its a shorthand for <span class="code-b">align-items</span> and
            <span class="code-btn">justify content</span> respectivly (align
            value comes before justify value) <br />
            <b>note</b> that in flexbox justify-items doesn't work as children
            are treated as one on the main axis so in case of row is main axis
            the second value will be ignored in flexbox. <br />
            <b>
              same explanation goes with
              <span class="code-btn">place-content</span>
              and
              <span class="code-btn">place-self</span> <br />

          <h3>:after & :before don't work</h3>

            according to answer on

          <h3>gap is not working properly</h3>
          <p>
            I noticed in the section in the image below that the separator is
            not exactly in the middle
          </p>
          <img src="images/gap-not-working-properly.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            the proplem was from the padding of the inputs was changing their
            width and hence all the containers on them causing the gap to push
            the form only
          </p>
          <p>solution was to explicitly set the width of the input to 100%</p>

          </div>
          <p>
            the main difference between the two is that use felxbox if you want
            to control the content in <b>one direction</b> (row or column) and
            use grid if you want to control the content in
            <b>both directions</b> (row and column).Like the pervious images may
            illustrate.
          </p>
          <p>
            another piece of advice to help you decide is to ask your self
            <br />
            <span class="second-color"
              >Do you want your content to shape your layout ?</span
            >
            ==> use grid <br />
            <span class="seocnd-color"
              >Do you want your layout to shape your content ?</span
            >
            ==> use grid
          </p>
          <p>
            finally one piece of adviece: In grid-layout there is no way to
            change the size of <b>one single items</b> without changin the whole
            column.
          </p>
          <p>
            my opionion is
            <span class="second-color"
              >what ever gets the job done with less code you go with it</span
            >
            even if in your beginnings you write the same layout twice one with
            grid and one with flex to help you decide it's okay.
          </p>
          <div class="bg-second-color">
            <q class="text-bold">
              I think the key phrase here is ‚Äúdistributing space and aligning
              content‚Äù. Flexbox is all about taking a bunch of things (which
              have varying sizes) and fitting them into a container (which
              itself has a varying size).
            </q>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <q>
                  When people find Flexbox hard and weird, it is often because
                  they are trying to use Flexbox as a grid system ‚Äî trying to
                  take back control over sizing and space distribution. When you
                  do this, Flexbox can seem weird and hard as you are fighting
                  against the very thing that makes it Flexbox, i.e. that
                  inherent flexibility. <br />
                  Therefore, patterns which suit flex layout very well are those
                  where we are not so interested in having a pixel-perfect size
                  for each item. We just want those items to display well
                  alongside each other.
                </q>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <b>
              Remember that you can also switch layout methods, using Flexbox at
              one breakpoint and Grid at another.

        <h3>media queries for touch screens</h3>
        <p>
          article from
          <a href="https://web.dev/accessible-tap-targets/">web.dev</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the media features we can now test for with media queries is
          whether the user's primary input is a touchscreen (<span class="cb"
            >pointer</span
          >) and whether any of the currently detected inputs is a touchscreen
          (<span class="cb">any-pointer</span>). The
          <span class="cb">pointer</span> and
          <span class="cb">span>any-pointer</span>
          features will return <span class="cb">fine</span> or
          <span class="cb">coarse.</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A fine pointer will be someone using a mouse or trackpad, even if
            that mouse is connected via Bluetooth to a phone.
          </li>
          <li>
            A coarse pointer indicates a touchscreen, which could be a mobile
            device but may also be a laptop screen or large tablet.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>the following code targets devices with touchscreen</p>

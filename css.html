          <h3>animatoin delay</h3>
          suppose you have multiple elements (say 3) you want to animate them so
          each one is delayed by some duration (say 2s) than the one before it.
          <br />
          instead of using <span class="code-btn">animation-delay</span> css to
          delay each one which is not practical in case of big numners.You but
          customized <span class="code-btn">data-*</span> (say data-delay) on
          each one with the number of seconds (or milliseconds) delay you want
          for thet particular element and then wirte the following css:
          <span class="code-btn">animation-delay: attr(data-delay)</span>
          and now you have as many animations as you want seperated by certain
          cumulative duration with just one line of css üòÉ.

          <h3>
            justify self & justify items <b>work only with grid</b> and don't
            work with <b>flexbox</b>
          </h3>
          <blockquote>
            The <span class="code-btn"> justify-self and </span>
            <span class="code-btn">justify-items</span> properties
            <b>are not implemented in flexbox</b>. This is due to the
            one-dimensional nature of flexbox, and that there may be multiple
            items along the axis, making it impossible to justify a single item.
            To align items along the main, inline axis in flexbox you use the
            justify-content property.
          </blockquote>
          <b>
            as in the flexbox (on the main axis) children are treated as a group

              note in order to be able to explain the difference we will talk
              about grid element
            </b>

          <p>
            <span class="second-color">visually: </span>
            <span class="code-btn">align-item</span> aligns each item in its own
            grid area.
          </p>
          <p>
            while in <span class="code-btn">align-content</span> will pack them
            in the top of the container. like shown in the pervious image.

          <p>
            example: <span class="code-btn">align-items: start</span> will
            results in the image below.

          <p>
            <span class="second-color">under the hood: </span>
            <span class="code-btn">align-items</span> sets the value of
            <span class="code-btn">align-self</span> for all child elements at
            once.
          </p>

          <p>
            while <span class="code-btn">align-content</span> deals with the
            grid lines itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>
              the images below are for align-conetent start and align-conetent

            <span class="second-color"> why the elements got taller ? </span>
            <br />
            in the code on mdn the first two elemnts were set to span to rows
            <b>so</b> it's basically stretches from the beginning of the first
            row to the end of the second row and since the space between the
            rows got taller the end of the row got further resulting in the
            elements got taller.

          <h3>:focus-within</h3>
          <p>
            it applies style on the element if the element itself or any of its
            children is focused
          </p>
          <p>
            in the case with just <span class="code-btn">:focus</span> when you
            focus on any of the elements children the focus on the elemenet is
            lost

        <section>
          <h3>place-items</h3>
          <p>
            its a shorthand for <span class="code-b">align-items</span> and
            <span class="code-btn">justify content</span> respectivly (align
            value comes before justify value) <br />
            <b>note</b> that in flexbox justify-items doesn't work as children
            are treated as one on the main axis so in case of row is main axis
            the second value will be ignored in flexbox. <br />
            <b>
              same explanation goes with
              <span class="code-btn">place-content</span>
              and
              <span class="code-btn">place-self</span> <br />

          <h3>:after & :before don't work</h3>

            according to answer on

              href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4574912/css-content-generation-before-or-after-input-elements"

          <h3>gap is not working properly</h3>
          <p>
            I noticed in the section in the image below that the separator is
            not exactly in the middle
          </p>
          <img src="images/gap-not-working-properly.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            the proplem was from the padding of the inputs was changing their
            width and hence all the containers on them causing the gap to push
            the form only
          </p>
          <p>solution was to explicitly set the width of the input to 100%</p>

          </div>
          <p>
            the main difference between the two is that use felxbox if you want
            to control the content in <b>one direction</b> (row or column) and
            use grid if you want to control the content in
            <b>both directions</b> (row and column).Like the pervious images may
            illustrate.
          </p>
          <p>
            another piece of advice to help you decide is to ask your self
            <br />
            <span class="second-color"
              >Do you want your content to shape your layout ?</span
            >
            ==> use grid <br />
            <span class="seocnd-color"
              >Do you want your layout to shape your content ?</span
            >
            ==> use grid
          </p>
          <p>
            finally one piece of adviece: In grid-layout there is no way to
            change the size of <b>one single items</b> without changin the whole
            column.
          </p>
          <p>
            my opionion is
            <span class="second-color"
              >what ever gets the job done with less code you go with it</span
            >
            even if in your beginnings you write the same layout twice one with
            grid and one with flex to help you decide it's okay.
          </p>
          <div class="bg-second-color">
            <q class="text-bold">
              I think the key phrase here is ‚Äúdistributing space and aligning
              content‚Äù. Flexbox is all about taking a bunch of things (which
              have varying sizes) and fitting them into a container (which
              itself has a varying size).
            </q>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <q>
                  When people find Flexbox hard and weird, it is often because
                  they are trying to use Flexbox as a grid system ‚Äî trying to
                  take back control over sizing and space distribution. When you
                  do this, Flexbox can seem weird and hard as you are fighting
                  against the very thing that makes it Flexbox, i.e. that
                  inherent flexibility. <br />
                  Therefore, patterns which suit flex layout very well are those
                  where we are not so interested in having a pixel-perfect size
                  for each item. We just want those items to display well
                  alongside each other.
                </q>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <b>
              Remember that you can also switch layout methods, using Flexbox at
              one breakpoint and Grid at another.

        <h3>media queries for touch screens</h3>
        <p>
          article from
          <a href="https://web.dev/accessible-tap-targets/">web.dev</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the media features we can now test for with media queries is
          whether the user's primary input is a touchscreen (<span class="cb"
            >pointer</span
          >) and whether any of the currently detected inputs is a touchscreen
          (<span class="cb">any-pointer</span>). The
          <span class="cb">pointer</span> and
          <span class="cb">span>any-pointer</span>
          features will return <span class="cb">fine</span> or
          <span class="cb">coarse.</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A fine pointer will be someone using a mouse or trackpad, even if
            that mouse is connected via Bluetooth to a phone.
          </li>
          <li>
            A coarse pointer indicates a touchscreen, which could be a mobile
            device but may also be a laptop screen or large tablet.
          </li>

          <ul class="big-items">
            <li>
              <p>
                we install tailwind using
                <span class="cb">npm install tailwindcss</span>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                but first if you wanna keep track on the depndencies you install
                in your project you have to make a node
                <span class="cb">package.json</span>file using
                <span class="cb">npm init -y</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                and when you install any dependency it will be shown in here
              </p>
              <img src="images/node-package-dependencies.png" alt="" />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>using tailwind in your page is like using sass:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  you make a src stylesheet where you import everything belongs
                  to tailwind
                </li>
                <li>
                  then you run a tailwind script that process this style sheet
                  into a final style sheet which you link to your html
                </li>
              </ol>
              <img src="images/tailwind-stylesheet.png" alt="" />
              <p>now why would we do that?</p>
              <p>first you can use tailwind itself (don't know how yet)</p>
              <p>
                and second the good thing with the method is you can add your
                own custom css althogh the purpose of the framework is to not
                type any custom css but sometimes you have to add your own color
                or your own size of font or whatever
              </p>
              <p>
                and from what I know about tailwind so far is that at the build
                it elemenates all unuesd css so maybe thats why we use this
                method
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>file mangement</h3>
              <p>
                all the final page files go in a
                <span class="cb">public</span> folder (it is not mandatory but
                it's best practice I guess)
              </p>
              <p>
                and we make a <span class="cb">src</span> folder to put the src
                stylesheet that tailwind gonna process into the final stylesheet
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              to import tailwind into the src stylesheet you type this at the
              very begining of the page:
              <span class="cb">
                @tailwind base; <br />
                @tailwind components; <br />
                @tailwind utilities;
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                to set the script that converts the src stylesheet into the
                final one:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>go to package.json</li>
                <li>
                  at the "scripts" object you gonna find a test script you can
                  delete that if you want
                </li>
                <li>
                  inside the scripts object you gonna type the name of the
                  script you want lets call "build-css"
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    then in its value you gonna type
                    <span class="cb">
                      "tailwindcss build (the src stylesheet path in here) -o
                      (the public stylesheet path in here)
                    </span>
                  </p>
                  <p>so it's gonna look like this</p>

            to understand this error you need to know how tailwind works under

            Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML, JavaScript
            components, and any other template files for class names, then
            generating all of the corresponding CSS for those styles.
          </p>
          <p>
            which means you have to provide tailwind the path of the files that

          <h3>#5 - Tailwind Config</h3>
          <p>
            to generate a tailwind config file with all the utilities in it go
            to the termnal and type
            <span class="cb">npx tailwindcss init --full</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            but if you want to add your own or modify on tailwind you don't deal
            with this config file instead you generate a blank config file that
            has all your modification in order not to mess anything in the
            frameword and in order to be able to distinguish between your own
            css and tailwind's css
          </p>
          <p>
            to generate tailwind blank config file you type in the termnal
            <span class="cb">px tailwindcss init</span>
          </p>
          <p>if you want to add your own css like your theme colors</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                first you can visit these
                <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme">docs</a> to know
                the rules of adding your own css

              <img src="images/tailwind-customization.png" alt="" />
            </li>
            <li>go to your <span class="cb">tailwind.config.js</span></li>
            <li>you will find an <span class="cb">extend</span> object</li>
            <li>
              <p>
                and you add whatever you want following the rules shown in the
                image above. Like if you want to add a new color you type
                <span class="cb">
                  colors: {"the color you want": "the value",}
                </span>
              </p>
              <p>
                I noticed in the docs that every color has different shadows
              </p>
              <img src="images/tailwind-color-shades.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                but some how couldn't find them in the full config file to try
                to mimc them
              </p>
              <p>but when hovering on a color they start to show</p>
              <img src="images/tailwind-color-shades-config.png" alt="" />
              <p>and that's how to memic them</p>

          <p>to add your custom font</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              include the font in your project either by using the css rule
              <span class="cb">@import</span> or HTML
              <span class="cb">link</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                then go to extend in the
                <span class="cb">tailwind.config.js</span>
                and type
                <span class="cb">
                  fontFamily: {"whatever the name you want": ["value", "value"]

            </li>
            <li>
              then you can use by simply adding the class
              <span class="cb">font-</span>followed by the name you choosed for
              the font (heading in the image above)

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                any class in tailwind can be responive or used condtionally by
                adding the size of the screen you want, column and the the class
                you want <span class="cb">sm:</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                say you want the element to be displayed flex from the meduim
                size screens and up you type it like this
                <span class="cb">md:flex</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                this can be used with
                <span class="second-color">any</span> tailwind class
              </p>
              <img src="images/tailwind-screen-sizes.png" alt="" />
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                as you can notice in the media queries the sizes are used with
                <span class="cb">min-width</span> which is the mobile first
                approach
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Targeting a breakpoint range</h3>
              <p>
                By default, styles applied by rules like md:flex will apply at
                that breakpoint and stay applied at larger breakpoints.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you'd like to apply a utility only when a specific breakpoint
                range is active, stack a responsive modifier like md with a
                <span class="cb">max-*</span> modifier to limit that style to a
                specific range like: <span class="cb">md:max-xl:flex</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                Tailwind generates a corresponding max-* modifier for each
                breakpoint, so out of the box the following modifiers are
                available:

                If you need to use a one-off breakpoint that doesn't make sense
                to include in your theme, use the
                <span class="cb">min-[the screen size you want]</span> or
                <span class="cb">max-[the screen size you want]</span> modifiers
                to generate a custom breakpoint on the fly using any arbitrary
                value. like <span class="cb">min-[320px]:text-center</span>

            to add your own css like adding a background-image to a certain

            add it in the proccessed one while be overridden

          <p>
            in case you have some componenet that is repeated across the website
            like a card or button. Instead of copying and pasting the classes
            around you add these classes to a single class using the
            <span class="cb">@apply</span> rule
          </p>

              in the <span class="second-color">content</span> section inside
              <span class="second-color">tailwind.config.js</span> (where you
              add the paths of the files that use tailwind classes) the Paths
              are relative to your project root, not your tailwind.config.js
              file, so if your tailwind.config.js file is in a custom location,
              you should still write your paths relative to the root of your
              project.

          <h3>repeated styles</h3>
          <p>
            most of the time you have the same element repeated in the section
            like nav links or 3 card section where you want to add the same
            style classes for all of them. tailwind provided 3 ways to do that
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h4>Multi-cursor editing</h4>
              <img src="images/tailwind-multi-cursor.png" alt="" />
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Loops</h4>
              <p>
                you can have the info of the elements stored in a text form
                (like an api) and you loop through the element info typing the
                html structure once
              </p>
              <p>
                you can loop over the info using regular
                <span class="cb">js</span> or I lately learned about
                <span class="cb">pug.js</span>
              </p>
              <img src="images/tailwind-loop.png" alt="" />
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>making an actual component</h4>
              <p>
                the two solutinos above or good for elements that repeat in the
                same section but what if you have an element (component) that
                repeats across the whole website like a button
              </p>
              <p>
                you can either make a template for it using vue or
                <span class="cb">styled</span> element using react
              </p>
              <p>
                or (and I really don't recommend this) you can use the
                <span class="cb">@apply</span> rule
              </p>
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                but notice that the apply rule is straight css which defeates
                the purpose of using tailwind
              </p>

          <h3>custom styles</h3>
          <p>
            every custom css you add has a layer to go whether it's in the
            <span class="second-color">base, components</span> or
            <span class="second-color">utilites</span> or even just adding it to
            the <span class="cb">src style</span>
          </p>
          <h3>when and why to use these layers</h3>
          <p>let's start with the <span class="second-color">why</span>:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              tailwind organizes the classes in layers where base layer comes
              first then components then utilities where utilities overrides the
              first two layers and components overrides the base styles so
              explicitly categorizing your style helps in override and avoiding
              conflicts
            </li>
            <li>
              when you add your style in a layer it can be used with tailwind
              modifiers like <span class="cb">hover:</span>,
              <span class="cb">md:</span> and so on
            </li>
            <li>
              on build time tailwind removes all unused classes so if you just
              add your style in the src style without putting it in a layer it
              stayes even if it's unused
            </li>
          </ol>

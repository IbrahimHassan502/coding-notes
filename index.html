            <p>
              according to
              <a

              a button says that you are going to change the state of the
              website (either front or back end), whereas a link is going to
              take you somewhere else (and doesn't change the state of the
              website)
            </p>
            <p>
              they also said that you shouldn't style a link to like like a
              button or the other way around. And you can notice this phenomenon
              (styling call to aciton links like buttons) in marketing websites
              like playstation (so I decided to style call to actions like
              buttons as this is what the user familiar with)

              <h3>why to add them</h3>
              <p>
                If you don't set the width and height attributes the browser
                will wait unitl the image is loaded to calculate the dimentions
                of the image and then make a space for it and
                <b>it's bad for two reasons: </b>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  layout shift: the text being suddenly pushed down when the
                  image is loaded which is really annoying
                </li>
                <li>
                  increasing the loading time and decreasing the performance of
                  the page as the browser has to calculate the dimentions itself
                </li>
              </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h3>what happens when you add them ?</h3>
              <p>
                the browser takes the width and the height and put them in an
                <b>aspect-ratio</b> in the user agent so it makes a space for
                the image without the need of waiting it to download.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>note:</b> when you set when dimention with css (width or
                height) you should make sure you set the other dimention (height
                or width) to <span class="code-btn">auto</span>.Otherwise the
                value will still be taken the attriubte you specified before.
                <b>when you set the other dimention to auto: </b> the browser
                calculates it based on the aspect ratio it has (from the width
                and the height attributes) without the need of waiting the image
                to download
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <div class="container">
                <div class="h3">downsides</div>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    the implementation of the browser detecting the aspect-ratio
                    based on the width and the height attriubtes is still new
                    (around 2020). <br />
                    the aspect-ratio css proprety for images itself is still new
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    for responsive images like the code below
                    <img src="images/responsive-img-codesnippt.png" alt="" />
                    you can only set width and height attribute to the main
                    image and you can't set them to the images in srcset. <br />
                    the best solution so far is to make sure that all of them
                    have the same aspect-ratio
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    it doesn't work width <b>art direction</b> read about it if
                    you want I want brief it here as it's not relavent to me at
                    this time
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>ads: </b>
                    During the ad lifecycle, many points can introduce layout
                    shift:
                    <ul>
                      <li>When a site inserts the ad container in the DOM</li>
                      <li>
                        When a site resizes the ad container with first-party
                        code
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        When the ad tag library loads (and resizes the ad
                        container)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        When the ad fills a container (and resizes if the final
                        ad has a different size)
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    and the best solution introduced by web.dev is to
                    pre-reserve a space to the ad by setting dimetinos for an ad
                    container
                    <b
                      >and make sure it is in the page wheather the ad is loaded
                      or not to avoid layout shift when the ad fails to load</b
                    >. <br />
                    This solution can have some downsides like the ad being
                    smaller than the container you made which leades to blank
                    spaces.

                change one dimention by css you set the other one to auto to
                allow it to be calculated by the browser and to avoid stretched

          <h3>What are void elements in HTML?</h3>
          <p>
            HTML elements which do not have closing tags or do not need to be
            closed are Void elements. For Example &lt;br /&gt;, &lt;img /&gt;,
            &lt;hr /&gt;

          <h3>What is the advantage of collapsing white space?</h3>
          <p>
            In HTML, a blank sequence of whitespace characters is treated as a
            single space character, Because the browser collapses multiple
            spaces into a single space character and this helps a developer to
            indent lines of text without worrying about multiple spaces and
            maintain readability and understandability of HTML codes

          <h3>What are HTML Entities?</h3>
          <p>
            In HTML some characters are reserved like &lt;, &gt; , '/', etc. To
            use these characters in our webpage we need to use the character
            entities called HTML Entities. Below are a few mapping between the
            reserved character and its respective entity character to be used.

              (styling call to aciton links like buttons) in marketing websites

              <h3>why to add them</h3>
              <p>
                If you don't set the width and height attributes the browser
                will wait unitl the image is loaded to calculate the dimentions
                of the image and then make a space for it and
                <b>it's bad for two reasons: </b>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  layout shift: the text being suddenly pushed down when the
                  image is loaded which is really annoying
                </li>
                <li>
                  increasing the loading time and decreasing the performance of
                  the page as the browser has to calculate the dimentions itself
                </li>
              </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h3>what happens when you add them ?</h3>
              <p>
                the browser takes the width and the height and put them in an
                <b>aspect-ratio</b> in the user agent so it makes a space for
                the image without the need of waiting it to download.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>note:</b> when you set when dimention with css (width or
                height) you should make sure you set the other dimention (height
                or width) to <span class="code-btn">auto</span>.Otherwise the
                value will still be taken the attriubte you specified before.
                <b>when you set the other dimention to auto: </b> the browser
                calculates it based on the aspect ratio it has (from the width
                and the height attributes) without the need of waiting the image
                to download
              </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    the implementation of the browser detecting the aspect-ratio
                    based on the width and the height attriubtes is still new
                    (around 2020). <br />
                    the aspect-ratio css proprety for images itself is still new
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    for responsive images like the code below
                    <img src="images/responsive-img-codesnippt.png" alt="" />
                    you can only set width and height attribute to the main
                    image and you can't set them to the images in srcset. <br />
                    the best solution so far is to make sure that all of them
                    have the same aspect-ratio
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    it doesn't work width <b>art direction</b> read about it if
                    you want I want brief it here as it's not relavent to me at
                    this time

                  <li>
                    <b>ads: </b>
                    During the ad lifecycle, many points can introduce layout
                    shift:
                    <ul>
                      <li>When a site inserts the ad container in the DOM</li>
                      <li>
                        When a site resizes the ad container with first-party
                        code
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        When the ad tag library loads (and resizes the ad
                        container)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        When the ad fills a container (and resizes if the final
                        ad has a different size)
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    and the best solution introduced by web.dev is to
                    pre-reserve a space to the ad by setting dimetinos for an ad
                    container
                    <b
                      >and make sure it is in the page wheather the ad is loaded
                      or not to avoid layout shift when the ad fails to load</b
                    >. <br />
                    This solution can have some downsides like the ad being
                    smaller than the container you made which leades to blank
                    spaces.

          <h3>What are void elements in HTML?</h3>
          <p>
            HTML elements which do not have closing tags or do not need to be
            closed are Void elements. For Example &lt;br /&gt;, &lt;img /&gt;,
            &lt;hr /&gt;

          <h3>What is the advantage of collapsing white space?</h3>
          <p>
            In HTML, a blank sequence of whitespace characters is treated as a
            single space character, Because the browser collapses multiple
            spaces into a single space character and this helps a developer to
            indent lines of text without worrying about multiple spaces and
            maintain readability and understandability of HTML codes

          <h3>What are HTML Entities?</h3>
          <p>
            In HTML some characters are reserved like &lt;, &gt; , '/', etc. To
            use these characters in our webpage we need to use the character
            entities called HTML Entities. Below are a few mapping between the
            reserved character and its respective entity character to be used.

          <p>
            I realized that emmet is built-in VS code no need for extension put
            it didn't work with pug so you have to go to
            <span class="cb">settings.json</span>
          </p>
          <h3>how to open settings.json</h3>
          <p>
            honstely I don't know a direct way but I searched in the settings
            for emmet and there was this section offering to open settings.json
          </p>
          <img src="images/vscode-settingsjson.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            I searched for "emmet.includeLanguages" and added the following line
          </p>
          <img src="images/adding-pug-to-emmet.png" alt="" />
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            despite that vscode say that emmet support pug on their
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet">
              emmet docs
            </a>
            but it didn't work before I added myself
          </p>
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            also they say you can identify pug as pug or jade but it didn't work
            so I tried jade and it worked
          </p>
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            in adding new language to emmet the left side is the extenstion of
            the file like .pug, .html, etc... and the right side is the language
            so lets say you have a language emmet doesn't know like
            <span class="cb">.razor</span> but it's actually html you type
            "razor": "html"
          </p>
          <p>
            you could also add language to emmet from the settings interface
          </p>

          <h3>decimal point in a class error</h3>
          <p>
            appearantly pugjs has problem with the decimal point in some of
            tailwind css classes
          </p>
          <img src="images/pug-decimal-point.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            a quick solution a came up with is using the
            <span class="cb">(class='')</span> syntax to add the classes with
            decimal point

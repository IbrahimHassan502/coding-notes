        <p>
          wordpress is an open source software which means you can take a
          version an customize it as you whish
        </p>

        <h2 class="main-heading">two options</h2>
        <p>
          when it comes to making websites on wordpress you have two optoins:
        </p>
        <ul class="big-items">
          <li>
            <p>
              first you can make it on
              <a href="https://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a>
              which has the wordpress version setup, updated, secure and ready
              to go. which means you don't have to see what are the security
              problems and solve them and you don't need to check for updates.
              Just pick your plan and go
            </p>
            <h3 class="second-heading">disadvantages</h3>
            <p>
              far less customizable compared with the second option which is
              taking a version of wordpress on your machine and work it yourself
              as at the end of the day in case of
              <a href="https://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> they manage the
              website not you
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              second option is as mentioned is to download the software from
              <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">
                wordpress.org/download
              </a>

        <p>where you can:</p>
        <ul>

          <h3>05 - Setup WordPress On Localhost</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              first you need to download local server like
              <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html">XAMPP</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>after install is finished start both Apache and MySQL</p>
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                in the setup file of xampp wherever you chose it find
                <b>htdocs</b> this is the folder where you put the websites you
                want on the local server and it's the folder opened when you
                type <b>Localhost</b> in the browser
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download wordpress</a>.
              not a click bait ðŸ˜…
            </li>
            <li>
              after un-zipping the file copy the wordpress folder (which came
              from the zipped file) and past it in the <b>htdocs</b> folder
            </li>
            <li>
              go to <a href="http://localhost/wordpress">localhost/wordpress</a>
              <p>
                after you finish the install that link will lead you to the
                actual website, if you want to go to the adming panel got to
                <a href="http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin"
                  >http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/</a
                >

                  <p class="bg-second-color">
                    notice that you should create database with the name

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    to create the database (in course elzero said go to
                    localhost/phpMyAdmin but I fuond it outsite of htdocs (the
                    localhost) so I simply copied and pasted it
                  </p>
                  <p>then go to database tap</p>
                  <img src="images/phpMyAdmin-database.png" alt="" />
                  <p>type the name you want</p>
                  <p>choose utf8_general_ci for encription</p>
                  <p class="bg-second-color">
                    phpMyAdmin by default makes the user name root and no

                    )
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    to see the database user's in phpMyAdmin and their
                    permissisons go to privilleges

                  database host: 'localhost' (127.0.0.1 is the localhost) so you
                  can type it as 'localhost' or as numbers as you wish

                </li>

                  prefix: leave it as: wp_ (wordpress uses this prefix before
                  the name of its files in case of another files will be added
                  from different wordpress or different party with the same file
                  name they don't mix up)
                </li>
                <li>hit submit then 'run the install'</li>
                <li>type the site title you like</li>
                <li>
                  type the username <b>of the website</b> he typed a different
                  name than root so it's probably different username of the
                  database username
                </li>
                <li>whatever the password you like</li>
                <li>
                  if the password is weak and you like that way check the
                  confirm password checkbox
                </li>
                <li>type in the email you want to use for recovery cases</li>
                <li>
                  search engine visability: in case you <b>don't want</b> your
                  site to be archived by search engines (no one can get to the
                  website unless they have the link as it won't be visible in
                  the search) then check it. if you want your website to be
                  public just leave it unchecked

            he explained something about making another database and using the
            encription in the image below instead of the utf8_general_ci in case
            he wants to make another wordpress installation bu it didn't really
            understand wtf he wants

          <h3>06 - Setup WordPress On DirectAdmin</h3>
          <p>
            explained how to install wordpress if you have a domain and hosting,
            just like local wordpress install but on the server you bought
          </p>
          <p>
            also explained how to upload the files and manage them using
            <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">filezilla ftp</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            didn't find it suitable for me in the mean time so didn't take notes
          </p>

          <h3>07 - Setup WordPress on cPanel Website</h3>
          <p>
            same as the previous lesson but using "cPanel" instead of
            "DirectAdmin"
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>08 - WordPress in Your Language</h3>
          <p>
            to change the language simply go to sittings and you will find 'site
            language' showing you the installed and available languages
          </p>
          <p>choose the language then hit save changes at the page</p>
          <p>
            you can find the installed language files by going to the wordpress
            folder inside htdocs ===> wp-content ===> languages
          </p>
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            notice that at first the folder languages won't exist unless you
            change the site language one time at lease
          </p>
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            also notice that here we're changing the panel and controls language
            not the site content language (this is not how you make multilangual
            website)
          </p>
          <p>
            elzero went on and explained how you can make your own language
            files for wordpress and how to contribute in the translation
            projects but I found the info irrelvant so didn't take notes about
            it

          <h3>09 - Dig Deep Into WordPress Database</h3>
          <p>
            talking about each tabel in the wp database in case you needed to do
            major changes like changing a certain phrase or link that exists in
            hundreds of posts or in case you got hacked and don't have the admin
            username and password. From the database you can enter on admins and
            change the email and password
          </p>
          <ul class="big-items">
            <li>
              wp_commentmeta & wp_comments: are about the comments the visitors
              leave on the site posts
            </li>
            <li>
              wp_links: contains all the external links (elzero said it was
              about comptability and should be removed in the future and today
              is 17/11/2022 and it still here)
            </li>
            <li>
              wp_options: contains all the chosen settings like the blog name,
              the admin's email, etc...
            </li>
            <li>wp_posts: contains all the articles</li>
            <li>wp_postmeta: I don't fully understand it now</li>
            <li>wp_terms: contains the categories and tags of the posts</li>
            <li>
              wp_term_relationships: contains the relations between the database
              tables linking tags with posts and categories
            </li>
            <li>
              wp_term_taxonomy: contains the descreption of each catergory
            </li>
            <li>
              wp_users: contains all website users (I guess, still not sure if
              it's about just admins or all users)
            </li>
            <li>wp_usermeta: contains all info about all users</li>

          <h3>#10 - Tips to Secure Your WordPress Website</h3>
          <p>
            before securing wordpress you have to secure your machine (he won't
            talk about securing your machine he will talk about wordpress)
          </p>
          <p>quick tips to secure your wordpress site:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                first way is to secure the dashboard: one way to get to the
                dashboard is to type in the link of your wordpress site (either
                locally so you go to localhost/wordpress or hosted so you type
                the url to the domain you purchased) followed by
                <span class="cb">/wp-admin</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                you can make a firewall on any folder you have on your website
                (including the wp-admin) to make a firewall:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>elzero went to <span class="cb">direct admin</span></li>
                <li>
                  chose <span class="cb">password protected directory</span>
                  <img
                    src="images/wp-direct-admin-password-portected-directory.png"
                    alt=""
                  />
                </li>
                <li>
                  chose
                  <span class="cb">find a directory to password protect</span>
                </li>
                <li>chose <span class="cb">wordpress</span></li>
                <li>chose <span class="cb">wp-admin</span></li>
                <li>
                  in the <span class="cb">protected directory prompt</span> you
                  type the message you want it browsed on the firewall (like
                  staff only or whatever)
                </li>
                <li>type in the user who can access through the fire wall</li>
                <li>type in the password</li>
                <li>
                  check the <span class="cb">protection enable</span> checkbox
                  before the <span class="cb">save</span> button
                </li>
                <li>hit <span class="cb">save</span></li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                now when you try to access the dashboard you'll be asked to
                enter the username and password of the fire wall (to be able
                after that to enter the username and password to the actual
                site)
              </p>
              <img src="images/wp-dashboard-firewall.png" alt="" />
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                now notice if you type the website link followed by
                <span class="cb">/wp-login.php</span> it will open the dashboard
                login page just fine without authintication or firewall
              </p>
              <p>
                to solve the previous problem you can add a rename plugin to
                your website that will rename the
                <span class="cb">wp-login.php</span> for you so the hacker can't
                access it
              </p>
              <p>
                in the video elzero just googled
                <span class="cb">wp-login rename</span> and said that you can
                find the plugin that suites you best
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                another tip is to always make sure to update the wordpress
                version (from the dashboard) as they continously patch loopholes
              </p>
              <p>
                also you can enable auto update but be aware is it may break
                some stuff down in some customized wordpress versions
              </p>
              <p>
                just google wp auto update and you will find some codes to add
                to the wp-config file (he illustrated how to auto update I just
                don't have energy to type)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              only use the absolute neccessary plugins don't take the easy route
              and make any small thing using plugin just because you don't want
              to search how it's done
            </li>
            <li>
              don't use cracked or nulled plugins as it will probably contain
              viruses
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>make sure your password to access the site is hard to crack</p>
              <p>
                you can use a password generator like
                <a href="https://my.norton.com/extspa/passwordmanager">
                  identity safe
                </a>
                from norton
              </p>
              <p>
                and with such hard randomly generated password you might want to
                use a passowrd saving application like
                <a href="https://www.roboform.com/"> roboform </a> or you can
                just count on <span class="cb">google password</span>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              you can use a plugin to make a
              <span class="cb">two step verfication</span> or 2fa so when
              someone tries to access the website it won't let him (with the
              right username and password) it won't let him untill you verfy the
              login from your phone
            </li>
            <li>
              make sure you're with a good hosting company so the hacker doesn't
              hack you from the server
            </li>
            <li>
              make sure you're using the right file permissions (he illustrated
              them but I didn't like to type them)
            </li>
            <li>
              change the database prefix (wp_) to a hard complicated prefix so
              when the hacker tries to inject tables in the database and he
              can't know the right prefix he simply won't be able to inject
              these tables or they won't be effective
            </li>

            <h4>revisions</h4>
            <p>
              when you make several modification on a draft wordpress saves
              every version of the draft just like github
            </p>
            <img src="images/wp-revisions.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              when you click on it it will show you a comparison between the
              latest version (on the right) and the previous version (on the
              left) with a plus icon beside the added lines, and a minus icon
              beside the removed lines
            </p>
            <p>
              you can go from a versino to another using the slider at the top
              of the page with every line in the slider representing a version
            </p>
            <img src="images/wp-version-slider.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              also you can compare between any two versions by checking the
              "compare any two versions" checkbox on the right of the slider
            </p>
            <p>you can restore any revision you want</p>
            <img src="images/wp-restore-revision.png" alt="" />
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              it's a little annoying that wordpress compares versions in the
              code status not in the visual one so try to search how to make the
              comparison in the visual editor or status
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>article status</h4>
            <p>
              the default status is <span class="cb">draft</span> if you're done
              and want it to be reviewed by one of your team you can change it's
              status to <span class="cb">pending review</span> by checking the
              checkbox in the settings panel
            </p>
            <img src="images/wp-pending-review.png" alt="" />
            <p>then it will be added to the bending tab in the posts page</p>

            <p>obvously the schedule time is based on your timezone</p>
            <p>
              funny enough I found out that mytime zone was set to utc+0 and my
              actual one is utc+2

            <p>
              you can either choose your country by the name or you can choose
              the timezone by the numbers

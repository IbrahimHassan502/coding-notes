        <p>
          wordpress is an open source software which means you can take a
          version an customize it as you whish
        </p>

        <h2 class="main-heading">two options</h2>
        <p>
          when it comes to making websites on wordpress you have two optoins:
        </p>
        <ul class="big-items">
          <li>
            <p>
              first you can make it on
              <a href="https://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a>
              which has the wordpress version setup, updated, secure and ready
              to go. which means you don't have to see what are the security
              problems and solve them and you don't need to check for updates.
              Just pick your plan and go
            </p>
            <h3 class="second-heading">disadvantages</h3>
            <p>
              far less customizable compared with the second option which is
              taking a version of wordpress on your machine and work it yourself
              as at the end of the day in case of
              <a href="https://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> they manage the
              website not you
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              second option is as mentioned is to download the software from
              <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">
                wordpress.org/download
              </a>

        <ul>
          <li>download the software</li>
          <li>find support</li>

          <h3>05 - Setup WordPress On Localhost</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              first you need to download local server like
              <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html">XAMPP</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>after install is finished start both Apache and MySQL</p>
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                in the setup file of xampp wherever you chose it find
                <b>htdocs</b> this is the folder where you put the websites you
                want on the local server and it's the folder opened when you
                type <b>Localhost</b> in the browser
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">download wordpress</a>.
              not a click bait ðŸ˜…
            </li>
            <li>
              after un-zipping the file copy the wordpress folder (which came
              from the zipped file) and past it in the <b>htdocs</b> folder
            </li>
            <li>
              go to <a href="http://localhost/wordpress">localhost/wordpress</a>
            </li>
            <li>choose the language</li>

                  <p class="bg-second-color">
                    notice that you should create database with the name

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    to create the database (in course elzero said go to
                    localhost/phpMyAdmin but I fuond it outsite of htdocs (the
                    localhost) so I simply copied and pasted it
                  </p>
                  <p>then go to database tap</p>
                  <img src="images/phpMyAdmin-database.png" alt="" />
                  <p>type the name you want</p>
                  <p>choose utf8_general_ci for encription</p>
                  <p class="bg-second-color">
                    phpMyAdmin by default makes the user name root and no

                    )
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    to see the database user's in phpMyAdmin and their
                    permissisons go to privilleges

                <li>
                  database host: 'localhost' (127.0.0.1 is the localhost) so you
                  can type it as 'localhost' or as numbers as you wish

                  from different wordpress or different party with the same file
                  name they don't mix up)
                </li>
                <li>hit submit then 'run the install'</li>
                <li>type the site title you like</li>
                <li>
                  type the username <b>of the website</b> he typed a different
                  name than root so it's probably different username of the
                  database username
                </li>
                <li>whatever the password you like</li>
                <li>
                  if the password is weak and you like that way check the
                  confirm password checkbox
                </li>
                <li>type in the email you want to use for recovery cases</li>
                <li>
                  search engine visability: in case you <b>don't want</b> your
                  site to be archived by search engines (no one can get to the
                  website unless they have the link as it won't be visible in
                  the search) then check it. if you want your website to be
                  public just leave it unchecked
                </li>

            he explained something about making another database and using the
            encription in the image below instead of the utf8_general_ci in case
            he wants to make another wordpress installation bu it didn't really
            understand wtf he wants

          <h3>08 - WordPress in Your Language</h3>
          <p>
            to change the language simply go to sittings and you will find 'site
            language' showing you the installed and available languages
          </p>
          <p>choose the language then hit save changes at the page</p>
          <p>
            you can find the installed language files by going to the wordpress
            folder inside htdocs ===> wp-content ===> languages
          </p>
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            notice that at first the folder languages won't exist unless you
            change the site language one time at lease
          </p>
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            also notice that here we're changing the panel and controls language
            not the site content language (this is not how you make multilangual
            website)
          </p>

          <h3>09 - Dig Deep Into WordPress Database</h3>
          <p>
            talking about each tabel in the wp database in case you needed to do
            major changes like changing a certain phrase or link that exists in
            hundreds of posts or in case you got hacked and don't have the admin
            username and password. From the database you can enter on admins and
            change the email and password
          </p>
          <ul class="big-items">
            <li>
              wp_commentmeta & wp_comments: are about the comments the visitors
              leave on the site posts
            </li>
            <li>
              wp_links: contains all the external links (elzero said it was
              about comptability and should be removed in the future and today
              is 17/11/2022 and it still here)
            </li>
            <li>
              wp_options: contains all the chosen settings like the blog name,
              the admin's email, etc...
            </li>
            <li>wp_posts: contains all the articles</li>
            <li>wp_postmeta: I don't fully understand it now</li>
            <li>wp_terms: contains the categories and tags of the posts</li>
            <li>
              wp_term_relationships: contains the relations between the database
              tables linking tags with posts and categories
            </li>
            <li>
              wp_term_taxonomy: contains the descreption of each catergory
            </li>
            <li>
              wp_users: contains all website users (I guess, still not sure if
              it's about just admins or all users)
            </li>
            <li>wp_usermeta: contains all info about all users</li>

              for your first few clients show them what they will get for
              working with a freelancer who doesn't have any reviews, privileges
              like:
              <ul>
                <li>I can start working on your project right away</li>
                <li>being my only client helps me to work closely with you</li>
                <li>
                  to be responsive and focused on communicating with you, and
                  sending you updates regularly
                </li>
                <li>answering all your questions and concerns</li>
                <li>
                  I'll be motivated to work with you as long as it takes to get
                  the results you want with the best quality you can ask for and
                  even exceed those
                </li>
                <li>
                  I truly care about your project and I will help whenever I see
                  a chance even if it's not in the task you reqiure from me
                </li>
                <li>
                  having only your project on my plate makes it easy for to rely
                  on me to complete the project within the specified timeframe

              <h4>use client's name</h4>
              <p>hi Jane,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>focus on client</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><p>this project seems really exciting</p></li>
                <li><p>your project caught my attention</p></li>

              <h4>frustrations</h4>
              <p>
                I know it can be frustrating to find the right shopify developer
                that has the skills you need and who is actually motivated to
                work closely with you, and that you cant trust to get the job
                done right the first time
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>motivated and excited</h4>
              <p>
                I'm not like most others who take on as many clients as they
                can, then run off and disappear for weaks at a time. Instead, I
                intentionally target a smaller select group of clients that I
                can work closely with so we can get the exact results you're
                looking for, without you haveing to struggle through every step
                of the way so if you're looking for a motivated safe set of
                hands to take weight of this project off your shoulders and work
                with to get the job done right, then let's have a chat
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>use work examples</li>
            <li>
              <h4>clear next steps</h4>
              <p>here is how</p>
              <ol>
                <li>send me an upwork message</li>
                <li>
                  on upwork messages click the green "schedule a meeting"
                  button, choose 45 minutes
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                and I'll confirm a time slot. That way we can hop on a strategy
                call to discuss your project further and make sure we're a great

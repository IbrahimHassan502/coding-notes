          <img src="images/discernible-link-flag.avif" alt="" />
          <div>
            <p>
              links should have descriptive text so users with screen readers
              and assistive technologies understand what this link goes to. As
              there is an option in screen readers to read just links (not sure)
            </p>
            <h4>the problem</h4>
            <p>
              the problem comes when the link goes to a social media website
              (it's just an icon) or it's an article with "read more" or "see
              full article here" or even just "here"
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>solution</h4>
            <p>
              put all your accessability text in a
              <span class="cb">span</span> in the <span class="cb">a</span> and
              give it the next properties in css
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="cb">display:block;</span></li>
              <li><span class="cb">width: 1px;</span></li>
              <li><span class="cb">height: 1px;</span></li>
              <li><span class="cb">overflow: hidden;</span></li>
              <li><span class="cb">position: absolute;</span></li>
              <li><span class="cb">top: -10px;</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              notice you don't need to give the links
              <span class="cb">position: relative;</span>
              as you actually want all the accessible text to be -10px from the
              top of the document, so it's visually not there
            </p>

              Targets that are smaller than 48 px by 48 px or closer than 8 px
              apart fail the audit. When the audit fails, Lighthouse lists the
              results in a table with three columns:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                tap target ------------------> The tap target that is
                inappropriately sized.
              </li>
              <li>
                size ------------------------> The size of the target's bounding
                rectangle in pixels.
              </li>
              <li>
                Overlapping Target ----> Which other tap targets, if any, are
                too close.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>solution</h4>
            <p>
              1.Increase the size of tap targets that are too small. Tap targets
              that are 48 px by 48 px never fail the audit. If you have elements
              that shouldn't appear any bigger (for example, icons), try
              increasing the padding property:
            </p>
            <img src="images/target-tap-size-sol.avif" alt="" />
            <p>
              2.Increase the spacing between tap targets that are too close
              together using properties like margin. There should be at least 8
              px between tap targets.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              notice that the two pargraphs above are not two options they are
              two steps which means you should do both of them
            </p>
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              as personally I changed the font-size a little bit and the margin
              but the whole element height wasn't 48px it was actually 26px and
              I still passed the audits

            </p>
            <p>
              noticed this behaviour occures when you specify
              <span class="cb">items: </span> number equal to the actual item
              number in the html (if you place 3 items in the html and then

            <p>
              the method returns the styled text. In my case the text was

            <h3>tailwind stopped processing style</h3>
            <p>
              tailwind was working prefectly and suddenly stopped modifying the
              output style file
            </p>
            <p>
              the problem was that I added a wrong class name in the
              <span class="cb">@apply</span> rule
            </p>
            <p>
              so the <span class="cb">@apply</span> rule is a custom rule made
              by tail wind so if you add the wrong class name (a class that
              doesn't exist neither in their utility classes or the classes you
              add in the src style file) like
              <span class="cb">item-center</span> instead of
              <span class="cb">items-center</span> the "s" difference between
              the two appearantly treggered error in the framework that stopped
              it from proccessing
            </p>
            <p>
              it's not just the wrong class that can tregger that error.
              Forgetting to add the ";" at the end of the line (and for some
              reasons the editor doesn't added for you ) can tregger and error

          <h3>tips and tricks</h3>
          <ul class="big-items">
            <li>make a class for paragraphs</li>
            <li>
              paragraphs line height is 0 by default, as a quick fix a set it 1
              em and I don't know if this is right
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>margin center an element</h4>
              <p>
                on the top of the box model showing the marign and the padding
                of the element you can find a button that sets the right and the
                left margins of the elmenet to auto which centers it
              </p>
              <img src="images/webflow-margin-center.png" alt="" />
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>adjusting margin and padding multiple directions at once</h4>
              <p>
                to adjust to opposed directions of the padding or the maring
                hold <span class="cb">alt</span> while moving your cursor
              </p>
              <p>
                and to adjust all directions at once hold
                <span class="cb">ctrl</span>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>konw from where the property is inhertied</h4>
              <p>
                if a property name is light orange it means it's inherited if
                you click on the property name it will show the element which
                your selected element has inhertied the property from and beside
                the parent element you will also see an icon for the breakpoint
                where the property was set; for example if you change the font
                size on mobile landscap then go to the mobile portrait and click
                on font size you will see the mobil landscape icon beside the
                name of the element from which the selected element inherit from
              </p>

            <li>
              <h4>collapse or expand all</h4>
              <p>
                in the navigator you can collapse or exapnd all the elements in
                the navigator by clicking the two-arrow icon on the top right of
                the navigator
              </p>

              <h4>adding elements by command line</h4>
              <p>
                <span class="cb">ctrl + E</span> to open the command line then
                type whatever element you want press enter and it will be added
                at the current selected element

            <li>
              <h4>add variable color</h4>
              <p>
                click on the color in the styling panel, then at the bottom left
                you will find a plus icon click on it and it will add the color
                and let you choose the name of it

              <p>
                if you try to just drag a grid elmenet inside one of the cells
                of another grid element the editor will repalce the cell with
                the new grid element to overcome that
                <span class="cb">ctrl(hold) + drag</span> and then the editor
                will allow you to place the new grid element inside the cells

            <li>
              upload the font files (.woff, .woff2, etc...) from the site
              sittings on webflow (to know how to add fonts go to adding google
              fonts to webflow section)
            </li>

              <p>
                in case of fontello you find in a comment on the side of the

              </p>
            </li>
            <li>paste the glyph in the text block</li>
            <li>
              set the font family of the text block to the font you uploaded

        <!-- animation -->
        <section>
          <h3>animation</h3>
          <p>to add an animation</p>
          <ol>
            <li>select the element you want to animate</li>
            <li>
              <p>
                click on the thunder icon on the right panel at the end of the
                line of style icon
              </p>
              <img src="images/webflow-animation-icon.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                as you can see there are two types of triggers: element trigger
                (like mouse click, mouse hover, mouse over element, scroll into
                view, and while scrolling in view)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                click on the plus icon beside the type you want to show you the
                optoins and choose the option you want
              </p>
              <img src="images/webflow-animation-options.png" alt="" />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>the follwing dialog will appear</p>
              <img src="images/webflow-animation-dialog.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                click on <span class="cb">select action</span> drop menu to
                choose action
              </p>
              <p>
                some times there are actions like fade in and fade out, etc...
                and some other time the only aciton is custom animation
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                if you choose custom animation (say we chose the custom
                animation in page scroll in the page trigger type), additional
                line will appear (scroll animations) showing you the animations
                you already have (our animation) and offering you to add another
                animation by clicking the plus icon beside the scoll animtion
                word
              </p>
              <img src="images/webflow-adding-animation.png" alt="" />
              <p>click it to add a new animation and choose a name for it</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                now you can choose actions to animate from the plus icon beside
                the (scroll actions) word
              </p>
              <img src="images/webflow-animation-actions.png" alt="" />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                once you choose the action you want two keyframes will appear
                one at 0% and the other at 100%, you can drag them along the
                timeline to choose where every keyframe starts
              </p>
              <img src="images/webflow-animation-timeline.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                as long as there is a yellow triangle on a frame it means
                there's something wrong with and sometimes hovering over the
                triangle can help you solve the problem
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>under the timeline you find the other options of the action</p>
              <img src="images/webflow-animation-timeline.png" alt="" />
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            when adding an animation make sure that you're using the same unites
            in both the starting and the ending animation <br />
            like in the move animation if you use vh in the x-axis in one of
            them you'll have to use vh in the x-axis in the other one other wise
            it keeps showing you the yellow triangle
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- audits -->
        <section>
          <h3>audits</h3>
          <p>
            to show the audits panel clikc on the check icon on the far left
            bottom corner of the screen
          </p>
          <img src="images/webflow-audits.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            sometimes you passed all the audits like in the image above and
            sometimes it will show you the errors like the image below:
          </p>
          <img src="images/webflow-audits-error.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            click on the arrow on the right of the error to show you the
            elmenets that have that error
          </p>
          <img src="images/webflow-audits-error-elements.png" alt="" />
          <p>when hover on the element two options will show on the right</p>
          <ol>
            <li>show me how to fix it which is the arrow icon</li>
            <li>ignore this which is the slashed bell icon</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            if you click ignore this the element will be added in the ignored at
            the bottom of the elements
          </p>
          <img src="images/webflow-audits-ignored.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            you can remove an element from the ignored by openning the ignored
            list, hover on the element click on the bell icon and it will be
            added back to the error element list
          </p>

        <!-- adding alt text -->
        <section>
          <h3>adding alt (alternative) text to images</h3>
          <ul class="big-items">
            <li>
              <p>
                one way to add alt text is to go to assets panel on the left
                colmun of the desginer, hover over the image and click on the
                gear icon on the top right corner of the image, then add the
                description you see fit
              </p>
              <p>
                this way can be practical in case you're using the image in
                multiple place in the website as all the images will have an alt
                text at once
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                another way to do it is to change the alt text for a specific
                image by clicking on the image in the website, click the gear
                icon that shows at the top of it, click the alt text drop down
                menu, and then choose custom description
              </p>
              <p>
                of course this way will change only this sepcific image you
                selected
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              he talked about adding alt text to a rich text and I don't
              understand that for the moment
            </li>
            <li>then he talked about cms and I didn't dig deep in that too</li>
            <li>
              he also talked about adding alt text to multi image field in cms
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            so when the image is considered decorative ? if the image is an icon
            or icon-like, like if you showing stats and numbers; it doesn't add
            meaning to the content of the website
          </p>

        <!-- vision preview -->

          <p>
            to open vision preview panel click on the screen size beside the
            different screens that are at the top of the designer, then find the
            vision preivew section in the menu then choose the option you want

        <!-- element stats -->
        <section>
          <h3>states</h3>
          <p>
            to set styling for the different states of an element click on the
            small down arrow icon beside the class list of the element in the
            styling panel and you will see the different states like hover focus
            and focus keyboard
          </p>
          <p>
            the difference between focus and focus(keyboard) that focus is
            applied either if you click the element, tap on touch screens or
            press tab on the keyboard and it uses the css selector
            <span class="cb">:focus</span> while the focus(keyboard) is only
            applied when selecting elements with the keyboard tab and uses the
            css selector <span class="cb">:focus-visible</span> I recommend you
            to read
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible"
            >
              MDN article
            </a>
            about it
          </p>
          <p>
            it can be useful in setting the outline of the elements when tab
            focused in order to enhance accessability
          </p>

        <!-- unitless properties -->
        <section>
          <h3>unitless proberites</h3>
          <p>
            to set a unitless number like in line height in the typography
            section of the element style you simply add hyphen after the number
            <span class="cb">-</span> like if you want the line height to be 1
            you type 1- and that sets the line height the same as the font size
          </p>
        </section>

          <h3>text blocks vs paragraphs</h3>
          <p>
            according to
            <a
              href="https://university.webflow.com/lesson/use-text-blocks-in-webflow"

            </a>
            text blocks should be used when using any other element is not
            logical in that situation like the copyright text at the footer we
            shouldn't use a paragraph for that I just found out this info right
            now
          </p>
          <blockquote class="bg-second-color">
            <i>
              A text block is a generic text element, best used for text that
              isn't a heading, paragraph, or link. A good example of this would
              be a copyright notice.

            text blocks are just divs with text in them this should help you
            understand how to use them but now since we just found out there are
            places where paragraphs are not suitable where else shouldn't use
            paragraph

            if you right click a class in the style selector section in the

            new class but with the same styling as the class you just

            tutorial the instructor found that one of the images (plane view of
            three bottles) had a different color than the background and he
            wanted it to look like a png (just the bottels without the color) so
            he selected it and scrolled down in the styling panel to
            <span class="cb">effects</span> and the first property was blending

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>css in figma</h4>
              <p>
                you can see the css of the element in figma by clicking on the
                dev mood icon in the far top right
              </p>
              <img src="images/figma-dev-mood.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                it will open the inspect panel where you'll find all the css
                properties of the selected element
              </p>
              <p>
                it also shows you the different dimensions like padding and
                margin and if you select an element and hover over to another
                element it will show you the space between them
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>show dimensions between elements</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>select the element you want</li>
                <li>hold alt</li>
                <li>
                  then hover over the element you want to measure the space
                  between it and the other element
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>px or rems</h4>
              <p>
                in the develper mood you can choose between showing dimentions
                with pixels or rems, I saw couple a videos talking about putting
                all dimentions in rems when working with webflow but not sure
                yet

            <li>
              you have to know the font size you working with (to set a class
              for it in webflow), and the color
            </li>
            <li>
              you have to know the padding of the sections in order to unite
              them
            </li>
            <li>export all the images and convert them into webp</li>

          <h3>Links do not have a discernible name</h3>
          <img src="images/discernible-link-flag.avif" alt="" />
          <div>
            <p>
              links should have descriptive text so users with screen readers
              and assistive technologies understand what this link goes to. As
              there is an option in screen readers to read just links (not sure)
            </p>
            <h4>the problem</h4>
            <p>
              the problem comes when the link goes to a social media website
              (it's just an icon) or it's an article with "read more" or "see
              full article here" or even just "here"
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>solution</h4>
            <p>
              put all your accessability text in a
              <span class="cb">span</span> in the <span class="cb">a</span> and
              give it the next properties in css
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="cb">display:block;</span></li>
              <li><span class="cb">width: 1px;</span></li>
              <li><span class="cb">height: 1px;</span></li>
              <li><span class="cb">overflow: hidden;</span></li>
              <li><span class="cb">position: absolute;</span></li>
              <li><span class="cb">top: -10px;</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              notice you don't need to give the links
              <span class="cb">position: relative;</span>
              as you actually want all the accessible text to be -10px from the
              top of the document, so it's visually not there
            </p>

              Targets that are smaller than 48 px by 48 px or closer than 8 px
              apart fail the audit. When the audit fails, Lighthouse lists the
              results in a table with three columns:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                tap target ------------------> The tap target that is
                inappropriately sized.
              </li>
              <li>
                size ------------------------> The size of the target's bounding
                rectangle in pixels.
              </li>
              <li>
                Overlapping Target ----> Which other tap targets, if any, are

          <div>
            <h4>solution</h4>
            <p>
              1.Increase the size of tap targets that are too small. Tap targets
              that are 48 px by 48 px never fail the audit. If you have elements
              that shouldn't appear any bigger (for example, icons), try
              increasing the padding property:
            </p>
            <img src="images/target-tap-size-sol.avif" alt="" />
            <p>
              2.Increase the spacing between tap targets that are too close
              together using properties like margin. There should be at least 8
              px between tap targets.
            </p>

              notice that the two pargraphs above are not two options they are
              two steps which means you should do both of them
            </p>
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              as personally I changed the font-size a little bit and the margin
              but the whole element height wasn't 48px it was actually 26px and
              I still passed the audits

            tailwind was working prefectly and suddenly stopped modifying the

          <p>
            so the <span class="cb">@apply</span> rule is a custom rule made by
            tail wind so if you add the wrong class name (a class that doesn't
            exist neither in their utility classes or the classes you add in the
            src style file) like <span class="cb">item-center</span> instead of
            <span class="cb">items-center</span> the "s" difference between the

            from proccessing
          </p>
          <p>
            it's not just the wrong class that can tregger that error.
            Forgetting to add the ";" at the end of the line (and for some

          <h3>gap is not working properly</h3>
          <p>
            I noticed in the section in the image below that the separator is
            not exactly in the middle
          </p>
          <img src="images/gap-not-working-properly.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            the proplem was from the padding of the inputs was changing their
            width and hence all the containers on them causing the gap to push
            the form only
          </p>
          <p>solution was to explicitly set the width of the input to 100%</p>

          you place an input:type="text" and attach the following function to it
          <span class="cb">onfocus="(this.type='date')"</span>

        </p>
        <p>
          in case you want the input to be back to text (which I don't
          recommend) you can attach
          <span class="cb">onblur="(this.type='text')"</span> to it

            <li>make a class for paragraphs</li>
            <li>
              paragraphs line height is 0 by default, as a quick fix a set it 1
              em and I don't know if this is right

            <li>
              <h4>margin center an element</h4>
              <p>
                on the top of the box model showing the marign and the padding
                of the element you can find a button that sets the right and the
                left margins of the elmenet to auto which centers it
              </p>
              <img src="images/webflow-margin-center.png" alt="" />
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>adjusting margin and padding multiple directions at once</h4>
              <p>
                to adjust to opposed directions of the padding or the maring
                hold <span class="cb">alt</span> while moving your cursor
              </p>
              <p>
                and to adjust all directions at once hold
                <span class="cb">ctrl</span>

            <li>
              <h4>konw from where the property is inhertied</h4>
              <p>
                if a property name is light orange it means it's inherited if
                you click on the property name it will show the element which
                your selected element has inhertied the property from and beside
                the parent element you will also see an icon for the breakpoint
                where the property was set; for example if you change the font
                size on mobile landscap then go to the mobile portrait and click
                on font size you will see the mobil landscape icon beside the
                name of the element from which the selected element inherit from

                in the navigator you can collapse or exapnd all the elements in
                the navigator by clicking the two-arrow icon on the top right of
                the navigator

            <li>
              <p>
                if you choose custom animation (say we chose the custom
                animation in page scroll in the page trigger type), additional
                line will appear (scroll animations) showing you the animations
                you already have (our animation) and offering you to add another

                once you choose the action you want two keyframes will appear

              <p>
                as long as there is a yellow triangle on a frame it means
                there's something wrong with and sometimes hovering over the

            when adding an animation make sure that you're using the same unites

            like in the move animation if you use vh in the x-axis in one of
            them you'll have to use vh in the x-axis in the other one other wise
            it keeps showing you the yellow triangle

            <li>
              <p>
                one way to add alt text is to go to assets panel on the left
                colmun of the desginer, hover over the image and click on the
                gear icon on the top right corner of the image, then add the
                description you see fit
              </p>
              <p>
                this way can be practical in case you're using the image in
                multiple place in the website as all the images will have an alt
                text at once
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                another way to do it is to change the alt text for a specific
                image by clicking on the image in the website, click the gear
                icon that shows at the top of it, click the alt text drop down
                menu, and then choose custom description
              </p>
              <p>
                of course this way will change only this sepcific image you
                selected
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              he talked about adding alt text to a rich text and I don't
              understand that for the moment
            </li>
            <li>then he talked about cms and I didn't dig deep in that too</li>
            <li>
              he also talked about adding alt text to multi image field in cms
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            so when the image is considered decorative ? if the image is an icon
            or icon-like, like if you showing stats and numbers; it doesn't add
            meaning to the content of the website
          </p>

          <p>
            to set styling for the different states of an element click on the
            small down arrow icon beside the class list of the element in the
            styling panel and you will see the different states like hover focus
            and focus keyboard
          </p>
          <p>
            the difference between focus and focus(keyboard) that focus is
            applied either if you click the element, tap on touch screens or
            press tab on the keyboard and it uses the css selector
            <span class="cb">:focus</span> while the focus(keyboard) is only
            applied when selecting elements with the keyboard tab and uses the
            css selector <span class="cb">:focus-visible</span> I recommend you
            to read
            <a

            it can be useful in setting the outline of the elements when tab

            to set a unitless number like in line height in the typography
            section of the element style you simply add hyphen after the number
            <span class="cb">-</span> like if you want the line height to be 1
            you type 1- and that sets the line height the same as the font size

            text blocks should be used when using any other element is not
            logical in that situation like the copyright text at the footer we
            shouldn't use a paragraph for that I just found out this info right
            now
          </p>
          <blockquote class="bg-second-color">
            <i>
              A text block is a generic text element, best used for text that
              isn't a heading, paragraph, or link. A good example of this would
              be a copyright notice.
            </i>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            text blocks are just divs with text in them this should help you
            understand how to use them but now since we just found out there are
            places where paragraphs are not suitable where else shouldn't use
            paragraph

            tutorial the instructor found that one of the images (plane view of
            three bottles) had a different color than the background and he
            wanted it to look like a png (just the bottels without the color) so
            he selected it and scrolled down in the styling panel to

          <!-- tips and tricks -->
          <ul class="big-items">
            <li>
              grid cells hold only one element by default to overcome this you
              can add a dive inside the cell to group multiple elements inside
              one cell or hold control then drag the each element into the cell
            </li>
            <li>
              to make a cell span more columns or more row simply click and drag
              the small ball on the right bottom corner of the cell
            </li>
          </ul>
          <!-- manually postion grid element -->
          <div>
            <h3>manually dragging a grid element</h3>
            <p>
              if you try to manually drag a grid element from cell to cell
              you'll find that it doesn't move
            </p>
            <p>
              to overcome this simply go to the postion section that is under
              grid child deopdown in the style panel and set the position to
              manual
            </p>
            <img src="images/webflow-grid-manual-postion.png" alt="" />
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              notice that when you manually postion an element that doesn't
              change it's order in the actual DOM so screen readers will still
              see it in it's original postion before you manually moved it
            </p>
          </div>
          <!-- automatically fill empty grid cells -->
          <div>
            <h3>automatically fill empty grid cells</h3>
            <p>
              In some cases when designing a grid you might encounter an empty
              cell of course you can drag an element in there to fill the gap
              but a more quick way is to go to
              <span class="cb">edit grid</span> section with the grid element
              (the parent with display grid) selected and check the
              <span class="cb">dense</span> option
            </p>
            <img src="images/webflow-grid-dense.png" alt="" />
            <img src="images/webflow-grid-dense2.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              so basically dense will fill the gap with the next available child
              as long as the child fits in the gap
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- auto fill -->
          <div>
            <h3>auto fill (or auto fit)</h3>
            <p>
              to make grid auto fill the instructor made a grid of one column,
              clicked on that column and from the top where there are the sizing
              options he chose <span class="cb">MinMax</span> and at the bottom
              of the panel checked the <span class="cb">auto-fit</span> option,
              and finally set the minmum width he wanted, and the maximum width
              left it at 1 fr
            </p>
            <img src="images/webflow-auto-fit.png" alt="" />
          </div>

          <!-- overlapping grid content -->
          <div>
            <h3>overlapping grid content</h3>
            <p>
              in order to span content freely without moving the other grid
              children around you should set the positioning of the children to
              <span class="cb">manual</span> instead of auto and in case you
              face a problem with the z-index just change the postion of the
              element you want at the top to <span class="cb">relative</span>
            </p>

                you can see the css of the element in figma by clicking on the

              <p>
                it also shows you the different dimensions like padding and

        <!-- extract image from psd -->
        <section>
          <h3>extract images from the psd</h3>
          <p>there are two ways to do this:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              the first way in photopea: (with the move tool active) simply make
              sure the image you want to extract or download is selected, then
              at the top right at the end of the second row of the editor you
              will find a down arrow to download the image
              <img src="images/photopea-download-image.png" alt="" />
              click on it, choose the format you want, and it will be downloaded
              in the downloades
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                notice that you can actually download any element using this
                method just the select the element you want and download it
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              the second way:
              <ol>
                <li>select the image or the element you want to extract</li>
                <li>right click and choose duplicate into</li>
                <li>
                  in the <span class="cb">destination</span> drop down menu
                  choose new project
                  <p class="bg-second-color">
                    I've seen some indian guy do a short cut to isolate the
                    image (everything else disappeared form the canvas) but I
                    don't know the shortcut as he was speaking indian and there
                    was no subtitles
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  in the new project go to the
                  <span class="cb">
                    image menu from the upper bar of the editor
                  </span>
                  and choose trim
                </li>
                <li>
                  from the file menu from the upper bar of the editor choose
                  export as then choose the format you want
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </section>

        <!-- show distances/spaces/dimensions/measurements -->
        <section>
          <h3>show distances/spaces/dimensions/measurements in psd</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                one way is: in photopea in the second row of the editor you will
                find checkbox called distances beside the transform control
                checkbox
              </p>
              <img src="images/photopea-distances.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                and this shows the distance from the edges of the canvas or the
                design to the selected elements, also with the element selected
                if you hover over another element it shows the distances between
                the selected and the hovered element
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                another way is to open the info tab with the element selected it
                will show you the width, height, x, and y values of the selected
                element.
              </p>
              <p>
                the x and y are the distances from the edges of the canvas to
                the element
              </p>
              <img src="images/photopea-info-panel.png" alt="" />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                another way would be to use the
                <span class="cb">ruler tool</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                you will find it by right clicking the eyedropper tool in the
                tool bar on the left
              </p>
              <img src="images/photopea-ruler-tool.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                just click any way in the canvas and drag to the point you want
                to measure the distance to. You can
                <span class="cb">hold shift</span> if you want to go in a
                staright line and the measurements will be shown in the option
                bar at the top
              </p>
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                to have a better experience using this tool you can show grid on
                the canvas
              </p>
              <img src="images/photopea-view-grid.png" alt="" />
            </li>
            <li>
              you can also use the
              <span class="cb">rectangular select</span> tool and it works just
              like the ruler tool
            </li>
          </ul>

        <section>
          <h3 class="main-heading">why use rems or ems instead of px</h3>
          <p>
            in case of px when a user changes the font size from the browser
          </p>
          <img src="images/browser-font-size.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            the font size will stay the same it won't change with the new font
            size and so all other fixed dimensions

          <h3>don't use 100vw</h3>
          <p>
            according to
            <a href="https://youtu.be/x4u1yp3Msao?si=kAQmHRGCJurqwR-o"
              >this video</a
            >
            some browsers like chrome don't account for the verticle scrollbar
            on the right which cause the website to have a horizontal scroll
            when you set an element width to 100vw

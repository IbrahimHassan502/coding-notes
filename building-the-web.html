          <img src="images/discernible-link-flag.avif" alt="" />
          <div>
            <p>
              links should have descriptive text so users with screen readers
              and assistive technologies understand what this link goes to. As
              there is an option in screen readers to read just links (not sure)
            </p>
            <h4>the problem</h4>
            <p>
              the problem comes when the link goes to a social media website
              (it's just an icon) or it's an article with "read more" or "see
              full article here" or even just "here"
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>solution</h4>
            <p>
              put all your accessability text in a
              <span class="cb">span</span> in the <span class="cb">a</span> and
              give it the next properties in css
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="cb">display:block;</span></li>
              <li><span class="cb">width: 1px;</span></li>
              <li><span class="cb">height: 1px;</span></li>
              <li><span class="cb">overflow: hidden;</span></li>
              <li><span class="cb">position: absolute;</span></li>
              <li><span class="cb">top: -10px;</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              notice you don't need to give the links
              <span class="cb">position: relative;</span>
              as you actually want all the accessible text to be -10px from the
              top of the document, so it's visually not there
            </p>

              Targets that are smaller than 48 px by 48 px or closer than 8 px
              apart fail the audit. When the audit fails, Lighthouse lists the
              results in a table with three columns:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                tap target ------------------> The tap target that is
                inappropriately sized.
              </li>
              <li>
                size ------------------------> The size of the target's bounding
                rectangle in pixels.
              </li>
              <li>
                Overlapping Target ----> Which other tap targets, if any, are
                too close.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>solution</h4>
            <p>
              1.Increase the size of tap targets that are too small. Tap targets
              that are 48 px by 48 px never fail the audit. If you have elements
              that shouldn't appear any bigger (for example, icons), try
              increasing the padding property:
            </p>
            <img src="images/target-tap-size-sol.avif" alt="" />
            <p>
              2.Increase the spacing between tap targets that are too close
              together using properties like margin. There should be at least 8
              px between tap targets.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              notice that the two pargraphs above are not two options they are
              two steps which means you should do both of them
            </p>
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              as personally I changed the font-size a little bit and the margin
              but the whole element height wasn't 48px it was actually 26px and
              I still passed the audits

            </p>
            <p>
              noticed this behaviour occures when you specify
              <span class="cb">items: </span> number equal to the actual item
              number in the html (if you place 3 items in the html and then

            <p>
              the method returns the styled text. In my case the text was

            <h3>tailwind stopped processing style</h3>
            <p>
              tailwind was working prefectly and suddenly stopped modifying the
              output style file
            </p>
            <p>
              the problem was that I added a wrong class name in the
              <span class="cb">@apply</span> rule
            </p>
            <p>
              so the <span class="cb">@apply</span> rule is a custom rule made
              by tail wind so if you add the wrong class name (a class that
              doesn't exist neither in their utility classes or the classes you
              add in the src style file) like
              <span class="cb">item-center</span> instead of
              <span class="cb">items-center</span> the "s" difference between
              the two appearantly treggered error in the framework that stopped
              it from proccessing
            </p>
            <p>
              it's not just the wrong class that can tregger that error.
              Forgetting to add the ";" at the end of the line (and for some
              reasons the editor doesn't added for you ) can tregger and error
              too

              upload the font files (.woff, .woff2, etc...) from the site
              sittings on webflow (to know how to add fonts go to adding google

              <p>
                in case of fontello you find in a comment on the side of the

            <li>paste the glyph in the text block</li>
            <li>
              set the font family of the text block to the font you uploaded

        <!-- animation -->
        <section>
          <h3>animation</h3>
          <p>to add an animation</p>
          <ol>
            <li>select the element you want to animate</li>
            <li>
              <p>
                click on the thunder icon on the right panel at the end of the
                line of style icon
              </p>
              <img src="images/webflow-animation-icon.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                as you can see there are two types of triggers: element trigger
                (like mouse click, mouse hover, mouse over element, scroll into
                view, and while scrolling in view)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                click on the plus icon beside the type you want to show you the
                optoins and choose the option you want
              </p>
              <img src="images/webflow-animation-options.png" alt="" />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>the follwing dialog will appear</p>
              <img src="images/webflow-animation-dialog.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                click on <span class="cb">select action</span> drop menu to
                choose action
              </p>
              <p>
                some times there are actions like fade in and fade out, etc...
                and some other time the only aciton is custom animation
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                if you choose custom animation (say we chose the custom
                animation in page scroll in the page trigger type), additional
                line will appear (scroll animations) showing you the animations
                you already have (our animation) and offering you to add another
                animation by clicking the plus icon beside the scoll animtion
                word
              </p>
              <img src="images/webflow-adding-animation.png" alt="" />
              <p>click it to add a new animation and choose a name for it</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                now you can choose actions to animate from the plus icon beside
                the (scroll actions) word
              </p>
              <img src="images/webflow-animation-actions.png" alt="" />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                once you choose the action you want two keyframes will appear
                one at 0% and the other at 100%, you can drag them along the
                timeline to choose where every keyframe starts
              </p>
              <img src="images/webflow-animation-timeline.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                as long as there is a yellow triangle on a frame it means
                there's something wrong with and sometimes hovering over the
                triangle can help you solve the problem
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>under the timeline you find the other options of the action</p>
              <img src="images/webflow-animation-timeline.png" alt="" />
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            when adding an animation make sure that you're using the same unites
            in both the starting and the ending animation <br />
            like in the move animation if you use vh in the x-axis in one of
            them you'll have to use vh in the x-axis in the other one other wise
            it keeps showing you the yellow triangle
          </p>

        <!-- audits -->
        <section>
          <h3>audits</h3>
          <p>
            to show the audits panel clikc on the check icon on the far left
            bottom corner of the screen
          </p>
          <img src="images/webflow-audits.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            sometimes you passed all the audits like in the image above and
            sometimes it will show you the errors like the image below:
          </p>
          <img src="images/webflow-audits-error.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            click on the arrow on the right of the error to show you the

          </p>
          <img src="images/webflow-audits-error-elements.png" alt="" />
          <p>when hover on the element two options will show on the right</p>
          <ol>
            <li>show me how to fix it which is the arrow icon</li>
            <li>ignore this which is the slashed bell icon</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            if you click ignore this the element will be added in the ignored at
            the bottom of the elements
          </p>
          <img src="images/webflow-audits-ignored.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            you can remove an element from the ignored by openning the ignored
            list, hover on the element click on the bell icon and it will be
            added back to the error element list
          </p>

        <!-- adding alt text -->
        <section>
          <h3>adding alt (alternative) text to images</h3>
          <ul class="big-items">
            <li>
              <p>
                one way to add alt text is to go to assets panel on the left
                colmun of the desginer, hover over the image and click on the
                gear icon on the top right corner of the image, then add the
                description you see fit
              </p>
              <p>
                this way can be practical in case you're using the image in
                multiple place in the website as all the images will have an alt
                text at once
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                another way to do it is to change the alt text for a specific
                image by clicking on the image in the website, click the gear
                icon that shows at the top of it, click the alt text drop down
                menu, and then choose custom description
              </p>
              <p>
                of course this way will change only this sepcific image you
                selected
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              he talked about adding alt text to a rich text and I don't
              understand that for the moment
            </li>
            <li>then he talked about cms and I didn't dig deep in that too</li>
            <li>
              he also talked about adding alt text to multi image field in cms
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            so when the image is considered decorative ? if the image is an icon
            or icon-like, like if you showing stats and numbers; it doesn't add
            meaning to the content of the website
          </p>

          <h3>vision preview</h3>
          <p>
            to open vision preview panel click on the screen size beside the
            different screens that are at the top of the designer, then find the
            vision preivew section in the menu then choose the option you want
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3>states</h3>
          <p>
            to set styling for the different states of an element click on the
            small down arrow icon beside the class list of the element in the
            styling panel and you will see the different states like hover focus
            and focus keyboard
          </p>
          <p>
            the difference between focus and focus(keyboard) that focus is
            applied either if you click the element, tap on touch screens or
            press tab on the keyboard and it uses the css selector
            <span class="cb">:focus</span> while the focus(keyboard) is only
            applied when selecting elements with the keyboard tab and uses the
            css selector <span class="cb">:focus-visible</span> I recommend you
            to read
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible"
            >
              MDN article
            </a>
            about it
          </p>
          <p>
            it can be useful in setting the outline of the elements when tab
            focused in order to enhance accessability

              <h4>css in figma</h4>
              <p>
                you can see the css of the element in figma by clicking on the
                dev mood icon in the far top right
              </p>
              <img src="images/figma-dev-mood.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                it will open the inspect panel where you'll find all the css
                properties of the selected element
              </p>
              <p>
                it also shows you the different dimensions like padding and
                margin and if you select an element and hover over to another
                element it will show you the space between them
              </p>

              <h4>px or rems</h4>
              <p>
                in the develper mood you can choose between showing dimentions
                with pixels or rems, I saw couple a videos talking about putting
                all dimentions in rems when working with webflow but not sure

          <img src="images/discernible-link-flag.avif" alt="" />
          <div>
            <p>
              links should have descriptive text so users with screen readers
              and assistive technologies understand what this link goes to. As
              there is an option in screen readers to read just links (not sure)
            </p>
            <h4>the problem</h4>
            <p>
              the problem comes when the link goes to a social media website
              (it's just an icon) or it's an article with "read more" or "see
              full article here" or even just "here"
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>solution</h4>
            <p>
              put all your accessability text in a
              <span class="cb">span</span> in the <span class="cb">a</span> and
              give it the next properties in css
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="cb">display:block;</span></li>
              <li><span class="cb">width: 1px;</span></li>
              <li><span class="cb">height: 1px;</span></li>
              <li><span class="cb">overflow: hidden;</span></li>
              <li><span class="cb">position: absolute;</span></li>
              <li><span class="cb">top: -10px;</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              notice you don't need to give the links
              <span class="cb">position: relative;</span>
              as you actually want all the accessible text to be -10px from the
              top of the document, so it's visually not there
            </p>

          <div>
            <h4>problem</h4>
            <p>
              according to
              <a
                href="https://web.dev/tap-targets/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools"
              >

              </a>
              Targets that are smaller than 48 px by 48 px or closer than 8 px
              apart fail the audit. When the audit fails, Lighthouse lists the
              results in a table with three columns:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                tap target ------------------> The tap target that is
                inappropriately sized.
              </li>
              <li>
                size ------------------------> The size of the target's bounding
                rectangle in pixels.
              </li>
              <li>
                Overlapping Target ----> Which other tap targets, if any, are
                too close.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>solution</h4>
            <p>
              1.Increase the size of tap targets that are too small. Tap targets
              that are 48 px by 48 px never fail the audit. If you have elements
              that shouldn't appear any bigger (for example, icons), try
              increasing the padding property:
            </p>
            <img src="images/target-tap-size-sol.avif" alt="" />
            <p>
              2.Increase the spacing between tap targets that are too close
              together using properties like margin. There should be at least 8
              px between tap targets.
            </p>

              notice that the two pargraphs above are not two options they are
              two steps which means you should do both of them
            </p>
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              as personally I changed the font-size a little bit and the margin
              but the whole element height wasn't 48px it was actually 26px and
              I still passed the audits

              are still not visible
            </p>
            <p>
              noticed this behaviour occures when you specify
              <span class="cb">items: </span> number equal to the actual item
              number in the html (if you place 3 items in the html and then

            <p>
              the method returns the styled text. In my case the text was

            <h3>tailwind stopped processing style</h3>
            <p>
              tailwind was working prefectly and suddenly stopped modifying the
              output style file
            </p>
            <p>
              the problem was that I added a wrong class name in the
              <span class="cb">@apply</span> rule
            </p>
            <p>
              so the <span class="cb">@apply</span> rule is a custom rule made
              by tail wind so if you add the wrong class name (a class that
              doesn't exist neither in their utility classes or the classes you
              add in the src style file) like
              <span class="cb">item-center</span> instead of
              <span class="cb">items-center</span> the "s" difference between
              the two appearantly treggered error in the framework that stopped
              it from proccessing
            </p>
            <p>
              it's not just the wrong class that can tregger that error.
              Forgetting to add the ";" at the end of the line (and for some
              reasons the editor doesn't added for you ) can tregger and error
              too
            </p>
            <h3>how you know you messed up ?</h3>
            <p>
              if you have the <span class="cb">--watch</span> termnal you notice
              with every modification you make you see it typing
              <span class="cb">rebuilding...</span> then

            <li>download the files of the library</li>
            <li>
              upload the font files (.woff, .woff2, etc...) from the site
              sittings on webflow (to know how to add fonts go to adding google
              fonts to webflow section)
            </li>
            <li>go back to the designer of webflow</li>
            <li>add text block</li>
            <li>
              <p>copy the icon glyf</p>
              <p>like in font-awesome:</p>
              <img src="images/fontawesome-glyph.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                in case of fontello you find in a comment on the side of the
                unicode of the icon in the fontello.css file
              </p>
              <img src="images/fontello-glyph.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                note they are in the form of ? as the computer doesn't have
                fontello font on it
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>paste the glyph in the text block</li>
            <li>
              set the font family of the text block to the font you uploaded

          <h3>quick tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>css in figma</h4>
              <p>
                you can see the css of the element in figma by clicking on the
                dev mood icon in the far top right
              </p>
              <img src="images/figma-dev-mood.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                it will open the inspect panel where you'll find all the css
                properties of the selected element
              </p>
              <p>
                it also shows you the different dimensions like padding and
                margin and if you select an element and hover over to another
                element it will show you the space between them
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>show dimensions between elements</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>select the element you want</li>
                <li>hold alt</li>
                <li>
                  then hover over the element you want to measure the space
                  between it and the other element
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>px or rems</h4>
              <p>
                in the develper mood you can choose between showing dimentions
                with pixels or rems, I saw couple a videos talking about putting
                all dimentions in rems when working with webflow but not sure
                yet
              </p>

            <li>
              you have to know the font size you working with (to set a class
              for it in webflow), and the color
            </li>
            <li>
              you have to know the padding of the sections in order to unite
              them
            </li>
            <li>export all the images and convert them into webp</li>

        <p>it stands for hue saturation brightness</p>
        <p>
          hue is basically the color itself then saturation is how vibrant
          (pure) or dull (greyish) the color is and birghtness is how bright
          (whitish) or dim (blackish) the color is
        </p>
        <p>
          hue varies from 0 to 360 with every number preseneting a different
          color
        </p>
        <p>where brightness and saturation vary from 0 to 100</p>
        <p>
          so by varying the saturation you are changin the place of the color
          point in the color picker horizontally, meaning that a 50 saturation
          and 100 brightness will but the point exactly at the middle top of the
          picker
        </p>
        <img src="images/ui-ux-HSB-50-sat.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          where a 50 saturation with 50 brightness will put in the center of the
          picker

              let's say you have a button with the main color and you want to
              make a varient of it with a darker color in this case you have to
              break it's link to the main color otherwise you'll be changing the
              main color itself
            </p>
            <p>
              you break the link by clicking the broken chain loop beside the
              color name

            <ul>
              <li>when making an animated element like a spiner</li>
              <li>
                when making an interacting element like button with hover state
              </li>
              <li>
                when repeating the same element with changes like pricing cards
                or navbar links
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>compenets with repeated elements</h4>
            <p>
              it's really important espicially with something like navbar links
              so when you need to make a change like the color or the casing of
              the letters you just change the parent component and all of them
              change instead of you going for one by one (just like classes in
              css)
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>how to make a component and varient</h4>
            <p>
              lets say we're making a navbar element. You want to make three
              states
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>the active state (usually home)</li>
              <li>the default one</li>
              <li>and the hover state</li>
            </ol>
            <img src="images/figma-component-and-varients.png" alt="" />
            <ul class="big-items">
              <li>
                <p>
                  the <span class="second-color">the best practice</span> that
                  you make a seperate component page
                </p>
                <p>
                  to make a new page click on the "page-1" on the right side of
                  left bar
                </p>
                <img src="images/figma-pages.png" alt="" />
                <p>
                  here I renamed it to "final design" but in default it says
                  "page-1"
                </p>
                <p>
                  once you click on it, it will open a list of all the pages you
                  have click the plus icon to add a page (figma allows 3 pages
                  per project in the free plan)
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                go to your component page, choose the type tool either from the
                top bar or by hitting "t" on the keyboard, then type the first
                navbar link you want which is usually "home"
              </li>
              <li>
                select that element and from the top bar hit the diamond-like
                icon
                <img src="images/figma-make-component-icon.png" alt="" />
              </li>
              <li>
                name your component from the right bar under
                <span class="cb">current varient</span>
                <img src="images/figma-component-naming.png" alt="" />
              </li>
              <li>
                make varient by selecting the component then in the place of the
                diamond-like icon you will find a plus icon looks like it when
                you click that it makes you a new varient, make the changes you
                want
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  then to make the hover state make a third varient with the
                  changes you like then from the right open the
                  <span class="cb">prototype</span>
                </p>
                <img src="images/figma-prototype.png" alt="" />
                <p>
                  hit the plus icon from the
                  <span class="cb">on click</span> dropdown choose
                  <span class="cb">while hovering</span> then hover over the
                  default state varient, a small plus icon will show up drag
                  from the icon then connect to the last varient which is the
                  hover state
                </p>
                <img src="images/figma-smart-animation.png" alt="" />
                <p>
                  from the <span class="cb">instant</span> dropdown menu choose
                  smart animation
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  now to use the component in the design go to the main design
                  page from the left bar choose <span class="cb">assests</span>
                </p>
                <img src="images/figma-assests.png" alt="" />
                <p>then drag the component and drop it in the design</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                to choose between the different variations from the right bar
                under the name of the component (which in our case called
                nav-item) click on the dropdown menu on the right of "property
                1" and choose the name or the state you want
                <img src="images/figma-choose-variation.png" alt="" />
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  to modify the compenent you don't modify the component instant
                  in the main design you go to the main component in the
                  component page and modify that
                </p>
                <p class="bg-second-color">
                  note that in that crash course the instructor made the changes
                  for the three varients one by one, so I'm not sure if that's
                  the only way or there's a way to make changes just once and it
                  applies for the three of them
